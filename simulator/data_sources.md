# Data Sources and Anchors

This project uses public, aggregated sources to anchor assumptions and constrain
plausible ranges.

Sources are not used to assert exact values.
They provide order-of-magnitude realism and defensible boundaries.

---

## Payment reliability

- Payment provider benchmark reports
- Industry blog posts and conference talks on payment success rates
- Public discussions of retries and failure recovery

---

## User trust and churn

- Checkout friction and abandonment studies
- Research on trust erosion in financial products
- Retention and churn benchmark summaries

---

## Credit and extension risk

- Public BNPL delinquency statistics
- Consumer credit default rate summaries
- Regulatory enforcement summaries (aggregated)

---

## Operational and incident cost

- Support cost benchmarks
- Chargeback fee disclosures
- Incident cost estimates from SRE literature

## Usage note

These sources are intentionally high-level.
They exist to ground assumptions, not to replace judgment or internal data.
